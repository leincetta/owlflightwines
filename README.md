# owlflightwines
Owl Flight wines takes its name from the pair of Barn Owls that took up residence in our vineyard. It has been such a pleasure to watch the owls raise their family each year as they keep watch over the grapes. The wines produced here at Owl Flight vineyard were done purely for selfish reasons. We like to drink wine. It seemed a good idea to put in a small vineyard to produce enough wine for our own consumption.
<br>
In the beginningâ€¦we used rented equipment. We soon realized the grapes were producing quite a bit more than the projected outcome we had calculated. We could not drink all that was being harvested. 
<br>
Which led to:
* A wine room; 
* temperature controlled cellar; 
* Equipment purchased; 
* and pros hired.

We are our proud of our little vineyard and the wines we are now producing. Thank you for stopping by.
