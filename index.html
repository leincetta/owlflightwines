                <h1>Proudly made in California</h1>
                <p>Owl Flight wines takes its name from the pair of Barn Owls that took up residence in our vineyard. It has been such a pleasure to watch the owls raise their family each year as they keep watch over the grapes.</p>
                <p>The wines produced here at Owl Flight vineyard were done purely for selfish reasons. We like to drink wine. It seemed a good idea to put in a small vineyard to produce enough wine for our own consumption.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In the beginning we used rented equipment. We soon realized the grapes were producing quite a bit more than the projected outcome we had calculated. We could not drink all that was being harvested.</p>
                <p>Which led to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A wine room;</li>
                    <li>temperature controlled cellar;</li>
                    <li>Equipment purchased;</li>
                    <li>and pros hired.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We are our proud of our little vineyard and the wines we are now producing. Thank you for stopping by.</p>
